        <h2>When a Busy Day Pushes the Front Desk to the Limit</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>80–100 incoming calls between appointments</li>
            <li>Phones ringing while the front desk handles check-outs</li>
            <li>Insurance verifications stacking up alongside scheduling requests</li>
            <li>Data entry happening between chair-side patient interactions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your team is skilled and genuinely cares. Most days they manage. But when multiple patients call at once or last-minute emergencies pop up, the system starts to feel stretched.</p>
        <p>Calls go to voicemail. Callbacks get delayed. Conversations feel rushed — even though everyone is trying their best.</p>
        <p>This isn’t a staffing issue. It’s the challenge of running a patient-first practice under peak load.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="before-patient">
        <h2>What Patients Feel Before They Sit in the Chair</h2>
        <p>Patients aren’t calling for casual questions. They’re in discomfort, anxious, or need clarity on treatment or insurance.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Uncertainty instead of reassurance</li>
            <li>Frustration instead of smooth scheduling</li>
            <li>Stress before even walking into the office</li>
        </ul>
        <p>First impressions happen over the phone. Trust is built (or lost) there.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="after">
        <h2>Imagine Your Front Desk Feeling Calm — Even on Double-Booked Days</h2>
        <p>Every call is answered quickly. Conversations are calm, clear, and consistent. Patients feel taken care of — right from the first ring.</p>
        <p>Your front desk team can focus on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Coordinating chair-side schedules</li>
            <li>Handling insurance and treatment questions</li>
            <li>Supporting patients in person</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Not getting pulled in every direction by ringing phones. Busy days feel manageable, not chaotic. Patient-centered care becomes reliable, no matter the patient volume.</p>

        <h2>How It Works — Without Disrupting Your Workflow</h2>
        <p>Meet your new voice AI — built just for dental offices. It works like an extra set of hands on your front desk:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Answers incoming calls immediately</li>
            <li>Handles outbound scheduling and reminders</li>

            <li>Keeps conversations consistent and professional, even when the schedule is packed</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is <strong>not</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Replacing your front desk team</li>
            <li>Touching your practice management system’s core</li>
            <li>Dependent on complex API integrations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It behaves the way your team already does — just without the stress.</p>

    <section id="why-now">
        <h2>Why Waiting for Legacy Systems is Riskier</h2>
        <p>Some offices hold out for larger software platforms to add voice functionality. But those systems are built for charting, billing, and compliance — not real-time patient conversations.</p>
        <p>Voice is an afterthought. Patient experience suffers during peak demand. And the front desk still feels stretched.</p>
        <p>The real risk isn’t trying something new. It’s relying on systems that weren’t built to handle patient calls at scale.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="adoption">
        <h2>Easy Adoption, Minimal Hassle</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>No new workflows for your front desk</li>
            <li>No retraining for patients</li>
            <li>Quick setup with no complicated integrations</li>
